Throughout my career, I've worked in technical and analytical environments—architecture, BIM, valuation, and data projects—which has allowed me to develop a way of approaching challenges through observation, organization, and a deep understanding of the problems. I enjoy learning 📚, improving existing processes ⚙️, and transforming complex information into something clear, useful, and actionable 💡.

🤝 I'm interested in continuing to develop in roles where I can learn by doing, collaborate with others, and contribute through rigorous analysis and continuous improvement, especially in contexts where the responsible use of data is key to generating value and making better decisions. I'm looking for opportunities in data analytics and data science 📈, in organizations or projects where I can continue to grow professionally, take on new challenges, and make consistent contributions.
